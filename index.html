 <p>      Here are links to videos as well as the powerpoint slides I made first. You'll have to hit the "back" button right now to get back to this page.  If you're going to skip some, skip the practice ones because quizzes are good practice too. Be sure to watch the divisibility one.       </p>  
 <p><i> On Repl.it these are relative links and their relatives aren't here (I'm not going to upload all those videos).</i> </p>  
 <!-- Fix these -- they're the relative links.   Or not -- go ahead and figure out this link.  After you shop.-->
