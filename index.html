  The sevens and eights Times Tables        <br></h1> 
<p>This is it!   If you've learned all the other ones, we've got four to go.      </p>
  <img src= images/timesChartNoRules.png class="chart" alt= "times tables chart facts from 0 to 10" >


 <p> For lots of people, the sevens are hard to learn because they don't have easy patterns -- but maybe you can find some of your own! The eights are like the twos and fours, but bigger.  </p>
 <p>      Here are links to videos as well as the powerpoint slides I made first. You'll have to hit the "back" button right now to get back to this page.  If you're going to skip some, skip the practice ones because quizzes are good practice too. Be sure to watch the divisibility one.       </p>    
 <!-- Fix these -- they're the relative links.   Or not -- go ahead and figure out this link.  After you shop.-->
